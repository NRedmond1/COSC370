Vector Distance Routing Program 2
Group Report

Description:
	We were able to successfully complete all the tasks required for program 2. First, we enter an error trace, which we
  used “2” as the input specified by the outline. This then starts the program into showing the distance tables and the
  time each event occurs. The tables will be shown after an update event or initialized event has occurred. Also, in the
  output file we have attached shows the final distance table for each node and it is highlighted in bold font. Lastly,
  the program will terminate and show the time and that there are no packets left in medium. We followed many references
  to get started on the program and research how to turn the lectures into programming code.
