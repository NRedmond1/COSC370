About:
  This project we incorperated different types of ecryption methods to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
  Algorithms included:
    -Reverse Encryption
    -Ceasar Cipher
    -Monoalphabetic Cipher
    -Vigenere Shift
    -Blowfish Encryption
    
Reverse Encryption:     Takes a string as input and returns the string in reverse order. 
Ceasar Cipher:          Takes a string in as input and uses a key (integer) to offset each character by that number of characters.
Monoalphabetic Cipher:  Takes a string in as input and has its own alphabet to what each character maps to. Just because 'A' goes
                        to 'J' does not mean 'J' goes to 'A'.
Vigenere Shift:         Takes a string in as input and uses a word as a key. The key is repeated to the length of input string. Then
                        each character of the string is offset by the matching character of the key.
Blowfish Encryption:    Current Algorithm used by many for a secure encryption. See file for more descryption.
